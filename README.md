============

Our project will attempt to use Tweets to predict the outcome of the Presidential election. We will focus our analysis on the presidential and vice-presidential debates prior to the election. We will use a natural language processing algorithms to analyze the content of Tweets and attempt to determine the user's attitude towards each candidate. We plan on using Python and a Twitter API developed in Python to compile a database of Tweet contents. We will then run this database of information through our NLP algorithm in an attempt to determine how favorably the users perceive the candidates views and statements. We will then compile our results into an overall analysis as to how favorable the public is to each candidate's ideas.
